JAVA 17 major features:
1)LANGUAGE FEATURES:First category: Nice developer-related features
################################################################
1.Switch Pattern Matching (Preview)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


2.Generate sealed Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
before knowing about sealed class we know that abstract class is maeant to be innherited and final class is not meant to be inherited
what if we need something between this concept?
you want to some class to be inherited  but not all the class here come sealed class
here you are restrcting the inheritance

How to achieve:
->make the class which you want to inherit(as sealed) and give permit for  the child classes
Ex:sealed class A permits B,C,D{
}

->the child class which inherited it should be either sealed,non-sealed,or final


sealed class B extends A{//
	
}
non-sealed class C extends A{////which can be extented by any class
	
}
final class D extends A{//no class can be extend this class
	
}
->we can sachiev in abstract class level also but child cant be final when you have child abstract class

//specificall for designing the appliatiom 
ex:playment gateways;'if you ant to accept only particular payment gateways or some thing like that scenario

-?we can achive interface level also but child cant be final when  you have child Interface (interface cant be final)


3.RECORD CLASS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
we will be having some class which will hold data (data carrying purpose)and  (not processing ,not buiness logic)
ex:

client asks for data-. to server- so server replies as objects and it conversted in jsonand come and same way if database it there server asks
database and give to client



4.TEXT_BLOCKS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
